        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>For our group's project, we wanted to see what countries have been historically successful
        at increasing its citizens' life expectancy year-over-year. We obtained our data from
        the website, <span class="emphasized">"The World Bank."</span></p>
        
        <p>The World Bank's Open Data website has global development data on all of the countries in the
        world. Each country comes with a plethora of information and statistics about its citizens.
        The data from the iFrame below is available to be downloaded to a create a CSV of the country's statistics.
        Total life expectancy year-over-year has increased considerably from a global perspective, but
        some countries have been more successful at it than others. Discover how life expectancy trends have evolved
        by visiting
            <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN?end=2020&start=1960&view=chart&year=2020">
                the webpage here.</a>

        <p>Naturally, one would think indicators like comparing a country's life exptancy to its GDP would be a
        good metric, but just doing that and calling it done and dusted lacks nuance and context to what a particular
        country could be doing well... every country is different, and how it increases its own GDP will be different
        compared to other countries, so we needed to look at the bigger pictures.</p>

        <h3>ETL/Pre-processing</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>After downloading all of the data, there were (understandably) a lot of rows of data to parse through.
        For the ETL and Pre-processing phase, we had to combine 213 different countries' CSV files to create a
        masterlist list of information that would then be converted into a Pandas Dataframe for analysis. Between
        all of the CSVS, there was a total of over 300,000 entries for the countries we imported into our
        PostgreSQL database through pgAdmin 4.</p>
        <img src = "static/images/sql_query.png" alt = "pgAdmin 4 Database Query"><br>

        <p>The master database was then converted into another invidual country's CSV so that the data can be properly
        read. The CSV's were currently set-up with years across the top instead of feature indicators, and that would
        pose problems in the future; an algorithm was used to transpose all of the matrices and recreate the per-country
        CSV files. The years 1960 to 1999 were also dropped to only utilize relevant data and to have our model learn
        from the most up-to-date indicators.
        </p>
        <div class="code-ex">
            # Per-country .csv generation loop<br>

        <p>Afterwards, more processing was done on the per-country CSVs to select features that had at least 90%
        of their data, i.e. had at least 9 years worth of information. Features that were missing more than 1 year
        of data was dropped, and the missing year would be later imputed using sk-learn.</p>

        <p>After processing all of the CSVs and parsing through the data, only retaining usable features, the
        individual countries' information was collected into a dataframe, and exported out into another CSV to be
        used for our PCA calculation.</p>

            &emsp;&emsp;else:<br>

            &emsp;else:<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;pass<br><br>

            df.replace ('BLANK', np.nan, inplace=True)<br>
            df.to_csv('Resources/worldbank_data.csv')
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div id="PCA" class="tabcontent">
        <h3>Principle Component Analysis</h3>
        <p>Externally, our master CSV with features and countries was transposed so now each country was a column
        in the header row and each feature was a row. The CSV was then imported into Pandas dataframe for further
        processing and manipulation</p>
        {% block content1 %}
        {{data1 | safe}}
        {% endblock %}<br>

        <p>sk-learn was used to impute the missing NaN values from the dataframe; this was done to ensure the
        analysis did not have any problems analyzing trends of each feature from country-to-country.</p>
        <div class="code-ex">
            # Impute NaN values using SKlearn Imputer<br>
            imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean', missing_values=np.nan)<br>
            imputer = imputer.fit(worldbank_df[[countries]])<br>
            worldbank_df[[countries]] = imputer.transform(worldbank_df[[countries]])
        </div>
        {% block content2 %}
        {{data2 | safe}}
        {% endblock %}<br>

        <p>The dataframe was then standardized using StandardScaler(), and PCA was performed using three
        principle components. Reducing the data gave us the following output:</p>
        <div class="code-ex">
            [0.77256764 0.12608949 0.04804051]
        </div><br>

        <p>Which told us that of the features examined, over 77% of features at any given time were of a relevant class...
        this is an important note that will be brought up again later. But for now, we used K-means clustering to confirm
        what our PCA was telling us, and it seemed to hold.</p>
        <img src = "static/images/K-means.png" alt = "K-means Elbow Curve"><br>

        <p>We then made a merged dataframe to see which class each feature was given, and we saw that an overwhelming
        majority were given Class 3. This is also visually evidenced by the large amount of features clustered into one
        section of our 2D scatters that we generated with the merged dataframe.</p>

        <h3>Lessons and Learnings</h3>
        <p>For the future, we realize our pre-processing methods and model devlopment could benefit from a lot of tweaks.
        Initially when we created the master dataframe, we had omitted the years 1960 to 1999 to only use relevant data;
        our PCA and model development could benefit from a larger pool of history to analyze trends across the years.
        Additionally we also constrained features to have at least 90% yearly completion, but that eliminated over 1,000
        features from our analysis; starting off with 1,445 features in our master dataframe and then coming down to only
        48, we saw a decrease of 97% of potentially usable data.</p>
        <p>This compounded later on when we ran our PCA and K-means clustering. As previously mentioned, our PCA was confident
        in predicting a 77% relevancy across the 48 features that remained, which was then evident in Class 3 containing 93%
        of the featureset in its grouping; this was consistent across country comparisons as well. If we were to increase the sample
        sizing of our dataset by either adjusting yearly history or decreasing acceptable data tolerance, we could potentially
        see a lot more variance in our PCA confidence as well as K-mean clustering. This would also give us a better indicator
        of which features are most relevant to life expectancy projection, rather than just simply having an overwhelming majority
        be represented; something like

            AG.LND.FRST.K2</a> might be better considered in future model development.</p>
